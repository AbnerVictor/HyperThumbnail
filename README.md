> As more high-resolution (HR) images are uploaded to cloud storage nowadays, challenges are brought to cloud service providers (CSPs) in fulfilling latency-sensitive image reading requests (e.g., zoom-in) through the internet. To facilitate faster transmission and high-quality visual content, our HyperThumbnail framework helps CSPs to encode an HR image into an LR JPEG thumbnail, which users could cache locally. When the internet is unstable or unavailable, our method can still reconstruct a high-fidelity HR image from the JPEG thumbnail in real time.

## üéè Abstract

HyperThumbnail is the first real-time 6K framework for rate-distortion-aware image rescaling.

> Contemporary image rescaling aims at embedding a high-resolution (HR) image into a low-resolution (LR) thumbnail image that contains embedded information for HR image reconstruction. Unlike traditional image super-resolution, this enables high-fidelity HR image restoration faithful to the original one, given the embedded information in the LR thumbnail. However, state-of-the-art image rescaling methods do not optimize the LR image file size for efficient sharing and fall short of real-time performance for ultra-high-resolution (\eg, 6K) image reconstruction.
To address these two challenges, we propose a novel framework (HyperThumbnail) for real-time 6K rate-distortion-aware image rescaling. 
Our framework first embeds an HR image into a JPEG LR thumbnail by an encoder with our proposed quantization prediction module, which minimizes the file size of the embedding LR JPEG thumbnail while maximizing HR reconstruction quality. Then, an efficient frequency-aware decoder reconstructs a high-fidelity HR image from the LR one in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous image rescaling baselines in rate-distortion performance and can perform 6K image reconstruction in real time.

```
cd ./BasicSR
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

### Datasets and pretrained checkpoints

You can download example images [here](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xyangbk_connect_ust_hk/EsGbMWqa2hxAtA8hBqJXo4MB3cIgKX2BZsLvKLge3i2kwg?e=wMzZNZ) and our pretrained checkpoint for 4x rescaling [here](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xyangbk_connect_ust_hk/EcAaTY1MS0FLvfI7_0ex4tABlr88_kZFAUJuipc2NX8WwA?e=Co37eJ) using bash command 

<!-- <details><summary>CLICK for the bash command using github release</summary> -->
```
bash download.sh
```
<!-- <details> -->

## Training
You may prepare DIV2K and Set14 datasets following [docs](BasicSR/docs/DatasetPreparation.md).
Then start the `4x` rescaling training using the config in the `options/train/4x/HyperThumbnail_4x.yml`.

```
python ./run.py -opt ./options/train/4x/HyperThumbnail_4x.yml
```

Tips: you can also go to [BaiscSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR) for detailed documentation of the training code.


## Inference

We provide a `4x` rescaling testing config in the `options/test/4x/HyperThumbnail_4x_test.yml`. You can start the testing by:

```
python ./run_test.py -opt ./options/test/4x/HyperThumbnail_4x_test.yml
```

## Export the jpeg HyperThumbnail

To export `.jpg` HyperThumbnail, you should install the [TorchJPEG (Ehrlich et al.)](https://gitlab.com/Queuecumber/torchjpeg/-/tree/master/) package.
